## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Install the Workflow**  
   Download the `.alfredworkflow` file and double-click to install.

2. **No Manual Setup Required**  
   This workflow includes its own **Python virtual environment**, pre-installed with all required packages (like `geocoder`).

3. **Requirements**
   - macOS
   - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with the Powerpack
   - Python 3 (recommended: via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

## Usage

Type your Alfred keyword (default is "sun") followed by a date like:

- `t` (today)
- `t+2` (two days from today)
- `04-19` or `04/19` (MM-DD)

If no argument is provided, it will display information for today.

## Install the workflow

Download the .alfredworkflow file and double-click it to install into Alfred.

## Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from https://timezonedb.com/api (required)
2. In "Configure Workflow" enter your API key
3. If you prefer to enter dates in DD-MM format, check the box for that
4. If you want to store a log file for debugging purposes, chdck the box for that

This workflow includes a self-contained Python virtual environment, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about dependencies.

## üß∞ Required Python Packages (for reference only)

You **do not** need to install these manually ‚Äî the virtual environment bundled with this workflow already includes them.

If you ever want to recreate the environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install geocoder

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'geocoder'

it usually means the virtual environment wasn‚Äôt bundled correctly or is not being used. Try re-installing the workflow or rebuilding the virtual environment using the steps above.

Your location is based upon your IP address, so if you're using a VPN your sunrise information will be based on the location of your VPN server.

### Optional Tweaks

If you want to edit the script, right-click the workflow in Alfred ‚Üí "Show in Finder" ‚Üí Open `SunriseSunset.py`.

## Background

I had a need for this functionality, so I used it as a learning exercise.

It utilizes a Python script, sunrisesunset.py. The script interprets and normalizes the argument, queries one server to find the user's location in latitude and longitude and then queries another server that provides sunrise and sunset information. The it parses the response and displays it.
